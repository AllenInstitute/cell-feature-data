a. dataset.json
b. feature_analysis.json or .zip depending on the size
c. feature_defs.json
d. images.json
e. card-cover.png (for display on the homepage)

For a group of datasets, ie a Megaset (the only file name that matters is `dataset.json`):
1. Create a folder with 1 file and one folder per dataset:
`dataset.json`
/dataset-1
    `dataset.json`
    ... the other 4 files listed above
/dataset-2
    `dataset.json`
    ... the other 4 files listed above
